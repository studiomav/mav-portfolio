# Michael Virga Portfolio
### A personal website

This repository is for my personal website that will showcase my projects created during the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.

The website is live on github pages [and can be viewed here.](https://studiomav.github.io/mav-portfolio/)

If all is well, the page should display like in this screenshot:

There is no license for this project and it is intended for educational purposes only.
